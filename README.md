<p>First, go to this <a href="https://notes-5cf6a.firebaseapp.com">link</a> to access the application hosted on firebase.
Then, follow the steps below:</p>

1. Register

2. Homepage
  <p>After registered, the user will be redirected to the homepage. Here, the user can do most of the functionalities of the app, such as creating a new note by clicking on the giant 'Add note' card button or by selecting this option on the sidebar menu on the left, as well as edit an already created note by simply clicking in it.</p>

3. Notes deleted
  <p>When a user deletes a note, it goes to the trash. There, the user can restore notes deleted or remove them permanently. There is     also the possibility to read deleted notes, but not to edit them (must restore them first).</p>
